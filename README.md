## Welcome to the Glowing Dust Particle Simulator!
If you'd just like to run the simulation, you can simply download the build files for [MacOS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjdXaZCjmV1u7f-V33hPorbFM31Sk-ru/view?usp=drive_link) or [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulhA3Zo7dG9Qh4mzNSu4ID9qay8XYs3d/view?usp=drive_link).
If you'd like to mess with the parameters of the simulation yourself, download everything and open the project up in Unity!
